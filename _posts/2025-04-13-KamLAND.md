<b>KamLAND</b> (Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector) is an electron antineutrino detector at the Kamioka Observatory, an underground neutrino detection facility in Gifu, Japan.
This project is conducted by the Research Center for Neutrino Science, Tohoku University, and involves numerous universities and institutes from around the world.

At the heart of the detector is approximately 1 kiloton of liquid scintillator (LS), a highly sensitive medium capable of detecting faint signals from antineutrino interactions.
KamLAND was originally designed to detect antineutrinos emitted from nuclear reactors located hundreds of kilometers away, providing groundbreaking confirmation of neutrino oscillations and thus evidence for neutrino mass.

In addition to reactor antineutrinos, KamLAND has also made pioneering contributions to the field of geoneutrino research by detecting antineutrinos originating from radioactive decays within the Earth's interior [(Nature, 2005)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03980). These measurements offer unique insights into the Earth's composition and heat production, highlighting KamLANDâ€™s crucial role in both particle physics and geoscience.
