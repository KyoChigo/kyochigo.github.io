From October 27 to 30, I attended an international conference called **Neutrino Geoscience 2025** in Kingston, a small city in Ontario, Canada.
This conference has a history of about 20 years, dating back to the first-ever detection of geoneutrinos by KamLAND.
Its aim is to bridge physicists and geoscientists, leveraging the potential of neutrinos to advance Earth science research.
In this time, more than 30 scientists from around the world and various disciplines participated and enjoyed the event.

As a student majoring in particle physics, I gave a talk on the Ocean Bottom Detector (OBD) project titled **"Revealing Mantle Heterogeneities with Future Directional Geoneutrino Detection."**
This work was conducted during the first half of this year, focuses on measuring the chemical composition of LLSVPs using directionally sensitive geoneutrino detectors.

Additionally, as a geoscience enthusiast, I presented another talk on skewed geochemical data, which is crucial for interpreting geoneutrino observations.
Over the past few decades, geochemists have often modeled skewed data using log-normal distributions. 
While this approach works well in many cases, the log-normal distribution lacks flexibility and sometimes fails to capture the data accurately.
In order to address this issue, recently, a lot of new models have been proposed.
In my presentation, I introduced the Burr distribution as an alternative to fit skewed geochemical data and found that it performs better than other models in many cases.
To foster discussion with geoscientists, I gave an additional talk titled **"Applying the Burr Type XII Distribution to Skewed Geochemical Data."**

Besides my presentations, the rapid development of the neutrino community has greatly expanded the range of topics covered.
This time, in addition to traditional geoneutrino detection, important topics included neutrino tomography, detection of K-40 geoneutrinos, and directionally sensitive detection methods.
For example, by measuring detailed neutrino oscillation (or attenuation) profiles, high-energy neutrino detectors can probe the Earth's internal density structure.
Also, using different detector targets can lower the IBD reaction threshold, allowing observation of K-40 geoneutrinos, as proposed by the LiquidO consortium.

Overall, Neutrino Geoscience 2025 was an inspiring event that highlighted the power of interdisciplinary collaboration between physics and geoscience.
The exciting advancements and diverse topics discussed reaffirm the great potential of neutrino research to unveil Earth's inner secrets.
I look forward to continuing my work at this frontier and contributing to deeper understanding through innovative detection techniques.
