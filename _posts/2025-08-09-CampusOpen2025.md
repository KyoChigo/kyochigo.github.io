On July 30th and 31st, 2025, I had the opportunity to participate in Tohoku University Open Campus 2025, representing the Neutrino Science Research Center.
During these two days, I was responsible for introducing our research activities to visitors, including many high school students.

Using a carefully prepared presentation, I explained the fundamentals of neutrinos, as well as some of the fascinating experiments conducted at our center, such as KamLAND and OBD.
In particular, I combined my knowledge of Earth sciences to give a deeper explanation of geoneutrinos and highlighted KamLANDâ€™s outstanding achievements in this field.
It was rewarding to see how the audience responded with genuine interest and curiosity.

By the way, we initially planned 6 presentation sessions, but due to overwhelming interest and large attendance, we excitedly added two more sessions on the spot.

Over 600 people visited our research center throughout the event, among whom were several international students.
I took the chance to engage in conversations with some of them, and to my surprise, I even met a fellow researcher working on the Super-Kamiokande experiment.
This unexpected encounter was a highlight of the open days for me.

Overall, the event was a wonderful opportunity to share our passion for neutrino science with a diverse audience and to inspire interest in science among students and the general public.
I hope that through this event, many future researchers, especially middle and high school students will feel the fascination of neutrinos and be motivated to join us in advancing this exciting field.
