I am very excited to share that the [official website for GEONU](https://geonucalculator.wstd.io/), a MATLAB-based geoneutrino flux calculation tool, is now online!

<h4>What is GEONU?</h4>

GEONU is a user-friendly coding tool designed to calculate geoneutrino flux for various geoneutrino detectors.
It also helps generate global predictions of the Earth’s radiogenic power, particularly in the mantle,
by using existing global crust models and providing a detailed, transparent description of every step in the code.

The program allows users to select from predefined geological and geophysical inputs, or define their own parameters for more advanced modeling.
Whether you are new to the field or already an expert, GEONU provides a flexible environment to explore how heat-producing elements shape our planet’s interior.

<h4>GEONU team</h4>
GEONU is developed through a cross-disciplinary collaboration among researchers from multiple institutions, combining expertise in geochemistry, particle physics, and computational modeling:

<ul>
  <li><strong>William F. McDonough (Tohoku University)</strong>: Project lead, focusing on planetary composition and geoneutrino modeling.</li>
  <li><strong>Laura Keen (MathWorks Inc.)</strong>: Developer and outreach specialist improving scientific modeling workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Tytrice J. Faison (University of Maryland)</strong>: Designed the GEONU GUI, website, and educational materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Shuai Ouyang (Shandong University / SNO+)</strong>: Re-implemented and optimized the GEONU codebase for better performance and flexibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Zhihao Xu (Tohoku University / KamLAND & OBD)</strong>: Contributed Python-based cross-checks of the flux calculations and helped validate the current implementation.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Looking ahead</h4>
It has been a rewarding experience contributing to a project that bridges geochemistry, particle physics, and computational modeling.  
With new features and integrations on the way, we hope GEONU will become a powerful tool for the global geoneutrino community.
