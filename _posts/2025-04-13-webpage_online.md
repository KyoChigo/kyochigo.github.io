I’m pleased to announce that my academic personal website is now up and running!
The page includes an overview of my research, recent presentations, and useful resources related to neutrino science.
I hope it provides a helpful introduction to my work!

Feel free to take a look — and don’t hesitate to get in touch with me anytime!
