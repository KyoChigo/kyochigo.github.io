I am excited to share some personal milestones from this year!
As a foreign student studying in Japan, giving scientific presentations in foreign languages has always been a challenge.
Preparing and presenting in English or Japanese can be really stressful, but the experience has been incredibly rewarding.
This year, I had the honor of receiving student presentation awards at 2 major scientific conferences in Japan:
One is JpGU (Japan Geoscience Union Meeting), and the another one is JPS (Annual Meeting of the Physical Society of Japan).

In May, at the Japan Geoscience Union Meeting (JpGU 2025) in Chiba,
I gave an oral presentation entirely in English on our Ocean Bottom Detector project,
exploring how angular resolution affects our understanding of Earthâ€™s heat from geoneutrinos ([see details](https://kyochigo.github.io/JpGU2025/)).
I was deeply honored to receive the Outstanding Student Presentation Award for this talk.
Presenting in English was very challenging for me, but receiving this recognition gave me a huge boost of confidence.

Then, in September, at the 80th Annual Meeting of the Physical Society of Japan (JPS) at Hiroshima University,
I presented in Japanese on the development of Ocean Bottom Detector for directly observing mantle geoneutrinos.
Also, my talk focused on evaluating the possibility of identifying large-scale structures in the Earth using directional-sensitive detection.
I was thrilled to receive the Student Presentation Award.

Being recognized in both English and Japanese not only encourages me scientifically, but also personally.
Overcoming the challenges of communicating complex research in a foreign language has been tough, yet extremely rewarding.
These experiences motivate me to keep exploring geoneutrinos and to continue growing as a researcher in an international environment.
