Recently, I attended **TAUP 2025 (19th International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics)** in Xichang, Sichuan, China, 
and gave an oral presentation on August 27 titled “Towards imaging Earth’s large-scale structures by directional geoneutrino detection with the Ocean Bottom Detector.”
In my talk, I briefly reviewed KamLAND’s past geoneutrino detections and introduced the future **OBD (Ocean Bottom Detector) project**, 
and discussed whether, if OBD had angular resolution, we could resolve the **LLSVPs (Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces)** and measure the concentration of radioactive elements within them.

The session was well attended, and although the Q&A time was limited to only 5 minutes, I received questions from 4 different participants. 
After the session, I also had fruitful discussions with senior colleagues in the neutrino community, especially on topics such as neutrino direction reconstruction and novel liquid scintillators.

During the conference, I had the opportunity to visit the **China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL)**, 
where I was impressed by China’s recent progress in underground experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay searches, and neutrino physics.
I also made many new friends and connections in the community.

Another exciting highlight was the news that **JUNO (Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory)** has officially started data-taking, 
which generated great enthusiasm among participants. We all look forward to their outstanding results.

This was my first time attending an international conference. Although I felt a bit nervous, I received very valuable advice and feedback.
The experience allowed me to learn from leading researchers, exchange ideas with peers, and gain a deeper understanding of the current developments in neutrino physics. 
I look forward to applying these insights in my future research and continuing to engage with the community.
